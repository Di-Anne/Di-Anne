## Hi there 👋

I'm an aspiring Software Developer. I enjoy building responsive web applications.

Before Tech, I was in the Marine Science and Conservation field. I encountered abit of coding for the first time while sailing across the Agulhas Current on a Research Vessel, the SA Agulhas II. With no prior experience in Tech, I made the bizarre decision to step outside of my comfort zone and quickly fell in love with programming. My goal is to fully transition into Software Development by this year, 2026.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Podcast App using React. Its my first time working with React! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning introduction to React. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building responsive websites and apps because I recently learned how to create them and I haven’t had enough practice yet. I plan to master JavaScript and React through hands-on experience with open-source projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with data structures and algorithms in vanilla JavaScript as I havent fully grasped them yet.
- 💬 Ask me about my journery thus far as a software developer part-time student. What were my highlights and challenges faced thus far.
- 📫 How to reach me: number: 0738374153 email: dianneleighwyngaard@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/ her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I disliked anything computer-related ever since high school and never imagined I’d find myself working behind one in my career hence why I chose Marine Sciences and Conservation. I thought Computer Science was only about how a computer works. But when I was introduced to coding, with all its intricacies and challenges, it ultimately piqued my interest and I’m excited to surprise myself by graduating in a completely different field.
