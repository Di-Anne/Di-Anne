## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a marine scientist who, in 2024, discovered abit of coding in oceanography while sailing across the Agulhas Current on a research vessel. With no prior experience in tech, I made the bizzare decision to step outside of my comfort zone and quickly fell in love with programming. I am currently studying the Software Development course, full-time, at CodeSpace.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first major portfolio piece which is to create an online resume. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS frameworks. I have started with tailwind and used it to create a responsive footer. Tailwind makes the design process alot easier because it allows me to use a pre-defined set of utility classes instead of writing new CSS styles in a stylesheet to construct UI elements.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building responsive websites because I recently learned how to create them, although I havenâ€™t had enough practice yet. I plan to master responsiveness through hands-on experience with open-source projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with responsive layouts using flex-box, grid and tailwind as I havent fully grasped them yet.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my journery thus far as a software developer student. What were my highlights and challenges faced thus far.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: number: 0738374153 email: dianneleighwyngaard@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/ her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I disliked anything computer-related ever since high school and never imagined Iâ€™d find myself working behind one in my career thatâ€™s why I chose Conservation. But, coding with all its intricacies and challenges, ultimately piqued my interest and Iâ€™m excited to surprise myself by graduating in a completely different field.
